    "- An IDE and a way to clone and push [Git](https://github.com/git-guides) repositories. \\\n",
    "Why an IDE: Beyond the fact that it looks nice, we use files and folders that may not be displayed properly (or at all) through a regular file navigator.\n",
    "- Accounts on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/), [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/en/pro/change-plan#developer) (choose the free plan, it's more than enough), and [MistralAI](https://mistral.ai/);\n",
    "- A way to deploy and run an API. We used [LightningAI](https://lightning.ai)'s API Builder feature, but any way to deploy an API and run a light LLM model should do just fine. \\\n",
    "Note that it may take a few days for you to get access to a free LightingAI account with 15 free credits. Write to LightningAI if you want a paid account now.\n",
    "- If you want to try it out locally: A reasonably up-to-date version of the Python programming language on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1.2 Set up the Web App Itself\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Log into the Hugging Face website, and click \"+ New\" > \"Space\".\n",
    "2. Give your new space a name.\n",
    "3. Under \"Select the Space SDK\", select \"Docker\", and leave \"Choose a Docker template:\" on \"Blank\".\n",
    "4. You can choose whether you want the space to be public or private, it shouldn't matter for now.\n",
    "5. Click the button to create your space, and keep the new web page you land on open.\n",
    "6. In your computer's command line, navigate to the folder where you want to store the app files. \\\n",
    "How to do this in [Windows](https://www.supportyourtech.com/articles/how-to-navigate-to-a-folder-in-cmd-windows-10-step-by-step-guide/) and [MacOS](https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html).\n",
    "7. Go back to the web page, and follow the on-screen instructions to clone the repo. The `git clone` or `hf download` command goes in the same place you navigated to the folder in step 6.\n",
    "8. You should now have a new folder where you chose, with the same name as the space you created. It already has a few files in it, but that's what you want.\n",
    "9. See the \"Hugging Face Spaces\" folder in this repo you're reading now? Copy/download all its contents to the new folder on your computer. You may need to remove the README and Dockerfile files that were already in there first, since we will replace them with the nifty new ones from the \"Hugging Face Spaces\" folder.\n",
    "10. Go back to your command line (where you ran the `git clone` or `hf download` command) and run this command: `git add . && git commit -m \"First commit\" && git push`. This should put the project files in your new space, and it will automatically try to run them. However it won't work quite yet.\n",
    "11. Go back to your browser, and click the \"Settings\" tab in the upper right-hand side of the page with the app trying to run. Scroll down all the way to \"Variables and secrets\" and add three secrets by pressing the \"New secret\" button. Secrets here are basically secret values that are stored in a way nobody can read (even you!), but that can be accessed by the code. Here are the secrets you need to set, with the exact same names:\n",
    "    - Name: MISTRAL_API_KEY \\\n",
    "    Get the value [here](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys) by opting to create a new API key.\n",
    "    - Name: DEEPL_AUTH_KEY \\\n",
    "    Get the value [here](https://www.deepl.com/en/your-account/keys).\n",
    "    - We'll set two others later on called \"BERT_API_URL\" and \"BERT_API_KEY\". This is for an API you'll set up in the next step. If you haven't got that far yet, you can skip these for now.\n",
    "12. If you have a preferred way of setting up an API, you can skip the rest of the steps and set it up yourself to connect the project in the \"LightningAI\" folder to it. Let @AengusBl know if you have issues. \\\n",
    "Log into the LightningAI website, create a new teamspace by clicking the \"+\" sign next to \"Teamspaces\", and then click on \"New Studio\".\n",
    "13. Once your LightningAI studio is up and running, upload the files that are in the \"LightningAI\" folder of this here repository to your new LightningAI studio.\n",
    "14. install libraries + set up APIBuilder\n",
